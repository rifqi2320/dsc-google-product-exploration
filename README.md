# Google API
### Google- what? What's that?
API stands for Application Programming Interface that means API is a computing interface which defines interaction between multiple software intermediaries.then Google API is an interface that helps your program connect straight into the google software such as Google Maps, Google Drive, and much more.
### Can you explain more?
Sure, let me pick you an API for example that i've explored.


## Google Drive API

Now, what can you do with Google Drive API? well, you can do a lot of stuff like:
* **Make folders** 📁
* **Upload files** ⬆️ 
* **Download files** ⬇️ 
* **Get link for files in Drive** 
* **Manage file metadata** ⚙
* **Shortcuts, shortcuts, shortcuts**
* and many more!

### B-but why? i can do that myself
With the API, you can write program to automatize it easily. You don't want to make 100 folders with your hand then name it all, or search a file in unrecognizeable pile of folder in your drive. With the API you can manage your files in your drive alot easier.

### Cool, now where do i start?
Well, well, well actually i don't know 😦. but you can explore it with me in [here](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/about-sdk).

## My Future Project
Well i hope that i can explore it more in the future so i can make projects with it
